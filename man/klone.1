.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 6
\fBklone\fR [\fB\ klone_opts\ \fR] [\fB\ cmd\ \fR] [\fB\ cmd_opts\ \fR] [\fB\ cmd_args\ \fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBklone\fR
performs two different tasks depending on the argument supplied to the
\fB\-c\fR
switch: import a site directory tree into the KLone building environment, or translate static and dynamic pages into C files.
.PP
The translation phase is rarely seen by the user since it is hidden in the Makefile of the site building directory, i.e.
\fI${KLONE_SRC_DIR}/site\fR. Generally, the developer gets an embedded version of his/her site by providing the following command sequence:
.sp
.nf
    $ cd ${KLONE_SRC_DIR}/site
    $ ../src/tools/klone/klone \-c import ${SITE_BASE_DIR}
    $ make
.fi
.sp
The latter
\fBmake\fR
invocation calls
\fB'klone \-c translate'\fR
over the imported files to perform the needed translation and registering (pre\-linking).
.PP
Note that whenever a source file is added, removed or renamed the import operation must be done again.
.PP
The subsequent phase, by which the embedded site is linked to the
\fBkloned\fR
server skeleton, does not involve
\fBklone\fR
anymore. Anyway it is given here for reference:
.sp
.nf
    $ cd ${KLONE_SRC_DIR}
    $ make
.fi
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"

Display a brief help and exit.

\-v
Enable verbose mode.
.TP
\-V
Print klone version and exit.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.HP 6
\fBklone\fR \fB\ \-c\ translate\ \fR \fB\ \-i\ infile\ \fR \fB\ \-o\ outfile\ \fR \fB\ \-u\ uri\ \fR
.PP
Translate the active (\fI.klone\fR) or static page
\fIinfile\fR
into the C file
\fIoutfile\fR. The
\fB\-u\fR
specifies the URI
\fIuri\fR
associated to the translated file.
.HP 6
\fBklone\fR \fB\ \-c\ import\ \fR [\fB\ \-b\ uri\ \fR] \fB\ dir\ \fR
.PP
Import the site tree starting at
\fIdir\fR
into the KLone building environment. The command output comprises two makefiles (\fIautogen.mk\fR
and
\fIautogen.dps\fR) and the
\fIregister.c\fR
file which will gather the imported and translated site files. The latter file is the glue by which the embedded site can afterwards be linked to the HTTP/S server.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
The
\fBklone\fR
utility exits with
\fBEXIT_SUCCESS\fR
on success, and with
\fBEXIT_FAILURE\fR
if an error occurs.
