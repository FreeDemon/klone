<H2>Specification</H2>

For requests which have information attached after the header, such as
HTTP POST or PUT, the information will be sent to the script on stdin.
<P>

The server will send <A HREF="env.html#cl">CONTENT_LENGTH</A> bytes on
this file descriptor. Remember that it will give the <A
HREF="env.html#ct">CONTENT_TYPE</A> of the data as well. The server is
in no way obligated to send end-of-file after the script reads
<CODE>CONTENT_LENGTH</CODE> bytes. <P>
<HR>
<H2>Example</H2>

Let's take a form with METHOD="POST" as an example. Let's say the form
results are 7 bytes encoded, and look like <CODE>a=b&amp;b=c</CODE>.
<P>

In this case, the server will set CONTENT_LENGTH to 7 and CONTENT_TYPE
to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The first byte on the script's
standard input will be "a", followed by the rest of the encoded string.<P>
